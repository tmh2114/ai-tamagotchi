## 🔄 Subtask Coordination

### How to Use This Plan
When working on a subtask:
1. **Read the entire plan** to understand the project vision
2. **Review your task's dependencies** to understand prerequisites
3. **Check related tasks** to ensure consistency
4. **Follow the architectural decisions** outlined above
5. **Update this document** if you make significant architectural changes

### Integration Points
Each task should:
- Expose clear interfaces for other components
- Follow established naming conventions
- Use consistent data structures
- Provide proper TypeScript types/interfaces
