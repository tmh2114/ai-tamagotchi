## Phases

### Phase 1: architect Phase
Tasks from architect perspective (raw output - needs manual parsing)

**Tasks in this phase:**
- [ ] [RAW OUTPUT] architect plan response
  - The architect agent provided the following response:

I've created a comprehensive UI & Design epic plan for the AI Tamagotchi project with **8 parallel epics** and **56 specific tasks**. The plan is saved as `tamagotchi-ui-design-epic-plan.json`.

### The 8 UI/Design Epics:

1. **Design System & Component Library** (6 tasks) - Foundation for all UI work
2. **Pet Visualization & Animation** (7 tasks) - Core pet visual experience
3. **Main App Interface** (7 tasks) - Primary app screens and navigation
4. **Interaction Interfaces** (7 tasks) - User-pet interaction mechanics
5. **Apple Watch Interface** (6 tasks) - Watch-specific UI components
6. **Data Visualization & Analytics** (6 tasks) - Metrics and progress displays
7. **Feedback & Status Systems** (6 tasks) - User feedback mechanisms
8. **Visual Polish & Branding** (6 tasks) - Final polish and brand identity

All epics can be developed in parallel by different teams, focusing on SwiftUI implementation for iOS 17+ and watchOS 10+. Each epic represents a complete UI subsystem that can be independently developed and tested.
- [ ] [RAW OUTPUT] developer plan response
  - The developer agent provided the following response:

I've created a comprehensive UI & Design implementation plan for the AI Tamagotchi iOS/watchOS app with 6 parallelizable epics and 46 specific tasks:

### Epic Structure:
1. **Core UI Components Library** - 8 reusable SwiftUI components
2. **Pet Visualization System** - 7 animation and rendering tasks  
3. **Main App Screens** - 8 primary iPhone interface screens
4. **Apple Watch Interface** - 7 watchOS-specific components
5. **Theme & Design System** - 8 design system tasks
6. **Animations & Interactions** - 8 motion design tasks

### Key Features:
- Native iOS/watchOS using SwiftUI
- Focus on pet interactions and animations
- Separate iPhone and Apple Watch interfaces
- Comprehensive theming and accessibility support
- Gesture-based interactions with haptic feedback
- SF Symbols integration for consistent iconography

The epics are designed to be developed in parallel by different team members, with clear dependencies noted (e.g., Theme & Design System should be completed first as other epics depend on it).

## üîÑ Subtask Coordination

### How to Use This Plan
When working on a subtask:
1. **Read the entire plan** to understand the project vision
2. **Review your task's dependencies** to understand prerequisites
3. **Check related tasks** to ensure consistency
4. **Follow the architectural decisions** outlined above
5. **Update this document** if you make significant architectural changes

### Integration Points
Each task should:
- Expose clear interfaces for other components
- Follow established naming conventions
- Use consistent data structures
- Provide proper TypeScript types/interfaces
