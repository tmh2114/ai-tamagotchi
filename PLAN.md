## Phases

### Phase 1: architect Phase
Tasks from architect perspective (raw output - needs manual parsing)

**Tasks in this phase:**
- [ ] [RAW OUTPUT] architect plan response
  - The architect agent provided the following response:

Error: Task plan-architect-comment-3267745824-1757361510857 timed out after 300000ms
- [ ] [RAW OUTPUT] developer plan response
  - The developer agent provided the following response:

Created comprehensive implementation plan for AI Tamagotchi with 7 epics containing 59 tasks organized into parallelizable work streams. The plan includes Core Data Models, AI/ML Services, Game Mechanics, iOS UI, WatchOS App, Integration Services, and Testing Infrastructure.

## üîÑ Subtask Coordination

### How to Use This Plan
When working on a subtask:
1. **Read the entire plan** to understand the project vision
2. **Review your task's dependencies** to understand prerequisites
3. **Check related tasks** to ensure consistency
4. **Follow the architectural decisions** outlined above
5. **Update this document** if you make significant architectural changes

### Integration Points
Each task should:
- Expose clear interfaces for other components
- Follow established naming conventions
- Use consistent data structures
- Provide proper TypeScript types/interfaces
